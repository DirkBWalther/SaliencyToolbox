The SaliencyToolbox is a collection of Matlab functions and scripts for computing the saliency map for an image, for determining the extent of a proto-object, and for serially scanning the image with the focus of attention. It has been cited in more than 1500 papers.

The code was originally developed as part of Dirk B. Walther's [PhD thesis](http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechETD:etd-03072006-135433) in the Koch Lab at the California Institute of Technology, made possible by funding from NSF and NIMH. 

System requirement: Matlab and Matlab Image Processing Toolbox.
